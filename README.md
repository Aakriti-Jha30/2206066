 Features Implemented
->Tested all API endpoints to ensure proper functionality
-> Designed the logic for Trending Posts (based on comment count)
-> Developed the logic for Top Users (based on post count)
 ->Set up navigation routes for seamless page transitions
 ->Integrated Node Fetch for API requests (although backend control could be improved)

Challenges Faced & Resolved
->CORS Issue: Required debugging and proper middleware setup
->Fetching Data: Used Node Fetch(postman was not working some problem in application runnning in my laptop this I had to think of an alternative to test and study apis), so backend control could be optimized in the future
